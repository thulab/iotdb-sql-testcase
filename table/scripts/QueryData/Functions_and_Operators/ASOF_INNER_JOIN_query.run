--7.1 当前仅支持ASOF INNER JOIN
select 
       t1.time as time1, t1.id as id1, t1.sys as sys1, t1.price as price1, 
       t2.time as time2, t2.id as id2, t2.sys as sys2, t2.quanty as quanty1

--7.4 某时段与上周时间段的ASOF JOIN 
select * from 
	(select time,
         sys as sys1,
         price as price1
    from quotes
    ) as t1

    t1.sys, 
    COUNT(*) AS trade_count, 
    round(AVG(t1.price),2) AS average_price

--8.支持ASOF LEFT JOIN
select 
       t1.time as time1, t1.id as id1, t1.sys as sys1, t1.price as price1, 
       t2.time as time2, t2.id as id2, t2.sys as sys2, t2.quanty as quanty1

         ASOF LEFT JOIN 
       trades t2

--9. ASOF JOIN 中time不应该为等于号”=“,不等于号”<>“

--10. ASOF JOIN 不支持使用USING语法
select
